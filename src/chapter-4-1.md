AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, which refers to the ability of computers and machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes tasks such as problem-solving, decision-making, and natural language processing.

AI systems are designed to learn from data, recognize patterns, and make predictions based on that data. They can be classified into three categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

What are Chatbots?

Chatbots are computer programs designed to simulate conversation with human users through messaging apps or websites. They use natural language processing and machine learning techniques to understand user inputs and respond with relevant information or recommendations.

Chatbots can be programmed to perform a variety of tasks, including customer service, scheduling appointments, and providing personalized recommendations for budgeting and financial planning.
